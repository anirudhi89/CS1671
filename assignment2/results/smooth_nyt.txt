Perplexity of 'Hedge fund titans in their Manhattan offices and day traders in their living rooms have poured billions of dollars into opaque, debt-fueled funds known as exchange-traded notes, racier versions of the exchange-traded funds that track every variety of index or investment and can be bought and sold just like a stock.' is 2.2528339778274997
Perplexity of 'Now stocks are swinging wildly and volatility is soaring � and investors who piled into these funds, confident that the calm would continue, are getting rattled.

Perplexity of 'After VIX shot up 100 percent, the largest move in its history, to 35.73 on Monday, Mr. Golden acknowledged that he was feeling some pain. On Tuesday, the index spiked again, reaching 50 before falling back to just below 30.' is 3.495354764228293

Perplexity of 'That Mr. Golden and others like him are getting hurt on these risky, niche trades should not, in theory, have a wider effect on the market. While investments in these funds have been substantial recently, their combined value is just $4 billion, a blip in a market worth trillions of dollars.' is 4.279616145161365

Perplexity of 'That was the case on Monday, bankers and traders said, when XIV collapsed as VIX soared in late-afternoon trading. That was because as XIV and SVXY plummeted, traders were forced to scoop up hundreds of millions of dollars in VIX futures to cover the short positions they had on the index.
